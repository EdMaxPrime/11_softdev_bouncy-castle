With your table buddy write the following html/js program:

+ HTML needs an svg element and a clear button.
+ When a user clicks on the svg element, a circle should appear.
+ All circles should immediately move around the screen in the same way as in previous assignments (dvd logo style).
+ The clear button should clear all circles and stop the animation
